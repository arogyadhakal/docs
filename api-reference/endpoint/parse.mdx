- Images: Credits based on image dimensions and file size
- Total cost is the sum of credits for all files

- Each file is processed independently
- PDF responses include structured data with page numbers, headings, and tables
- Image responses return plain text extracted via OCR
- Text extraction preserves line breaks where possible
