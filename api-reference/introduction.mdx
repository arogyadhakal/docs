## Welcome

The PDF Extractor API provides endpoints for parsing PDFs and images, asking questions about documents, and extracting structured data using AI-powered processing.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`:

```
https://your-api-domain.com/api/v1
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using a Bearer token in the Authorization header. Your API key must start with `pk_live_`.

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

### Authentication Header

Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer pk_live_your_api_key_here
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting based on your subscription plan. Rate limit headers are included in responses.

## Idempotency

All endpoints support idempotency keys via the `Idempotency-Key` header. When provided, duplicate requests with the same key will return the cached response without charging credits again.

```bash
Idempotency-Key: your-unique-key-here
```

## Credits

All API operations consume credits based on:
- File size and type
- Operation complexity
- Number of files processed

Credits are deducted from your active subscription bucket. Ensure you have sufficient credits before making requests.

## Supported File Types

- **PDFs**: `application/pdf`
- **Images**: `image/jpeg`, `image/jpg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`

## Error Responses

All endpoints return standard HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad Request (invalid parameters)
- `401` - Unauthorized (invalid or missing API key)
- `402` - Payment Required (insufficient credits)
- `403` - Forbidden (no active subscription)
- `500` - Internal Server Error
